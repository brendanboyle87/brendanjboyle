If you've been to my About Me page, you know that I got my start programming by doing the Launch Academy coding bootcamp. Prior to Launch Academy, I had done some basic tutorials and played around with Wordpress but that was about it. Four years after graduation, I'm a full time Software Engineer who loves his job. I'm often connected with people who are considering a bootcamp, currently enrolled in one, or are looking for a job post graduation. Whenever I have one of these calls I end up talking the person's ear off. I realized I have a lot to say on this topic so I am going to write a series of blog posts on bootcamp related topics. They are aimed at people in a similar situation to mine (little to no coding experience) This is the first post and it will be followed by the three posts below: 

Part 2: How to choose a programming bootcamp

Part 3: How to make the most of a programming bootcamp 

Part 4: How to land a job post graduation 



A lot of people I talk to that are considering joining a bootcamp jump right into asking how to evaluate the available options. This skips an important first step which is evaluating whether you should join a bootcamp at all. I think anyone considering a bootcamp should answer the following three questions: 

1. Why do you want to join a bootcamp? 

Bootcamps are usually referred to as programming or coding. They certainly teach coding but their focus (unlike a traditional computer science degree) is on teaching a specific set of skills that are attractive to potential employers as opposed to general programming fundamentals.

I've owned this domain for years and for most of that time its been a parked page. I've made a few attempts at starting a personal site in the past, usually using Wordpress. Wordpress is a great tool that powers millions of sites but anyone who has used it is probably familiar with the experience below:

### Using Wordpress: 

You pick out a webhost that has one click Wordpress deployment (I usually used BlueHost). It costs five dollars a month. You make your admin account. You install Wordpress and you browse free themes for way too long. You get the theme installed. You get it set up as a child theme to make sure you can update the theme without losing any customization. You starting adding the plugins your research says you need (SEO, Commenting, Caching, Security, etc.). You configure all of the plugins, and get your About Me/Contact pages ready. After all that is done you still have to worry about storage space on your host, Wordpress updates, what  to do if you saw a surge in traffic (okay probably not a huge problem for this blog) and a bunch of other things. 

### Using Gatsby.js and Netlify 

I came across Gatsby.js and Netlify

Welcome to my personal blog. I am a Senior Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments in Boston. I spend my day to day working with Java and Angular to build tools for Fidelity's investment professionals. I write about technical topics and other things I'm interested in. Lately, I've been focused on React/GraphQL and serverless architecture. 

I also write about transitioning into tech from another field. I was a practicing attorney prior to becoming a developer. I received a [scholarship](<http://lawmagazine.bc.edu/2015/09/boyle-12-wins-launch-academys-scholarship-challenge/>) to the Launch Academy bootcamp that changed my life. I want to encourage others thinking about making the leap to do the same.
